# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This project is a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** that demonstrates various scheduling algorithms, allowing users to visualize and understand their working principles. The simulator is implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and supporting scripts for different scheduling algorithms.

## Features
- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) Scheduling**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling**
- **Round Robin Scheduling**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Gantt Chart Visualization**
- **Process Management**
- **Simulation of Scheduling Algorithms**

## File Structure
- `completecode.html` - Main HTML file integrating all components.
- `webpage.html` - Webpage structure for displaying the simulator.
- `display.js` - Handles the output table generation.
- `fcfs.js` - Implementation of First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm.
- `sjf.js` - Implementation of Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm.
- `roundrobin.js` - Implementation of Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
- `priority.js` - Implementation of Priority Scheduling algorithm.
- `gantchart.js` - Generates the Gantt chart for visualization.
- `process.js` - Frontend process management.
- `simulate.js` - Handles simulation logic.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `completecode.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.).
4. Select a scheduling algorithm.
5. Run the simulation to visualize results.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- JavaScript-enabled environment
